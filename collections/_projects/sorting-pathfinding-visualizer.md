complete: false

description:
    The visualizer will use a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to select an algorithm, input a set of data, and visualize the algorithm's process in real-time. The GUI will also display relevant metrics, such as the number of comparisons, swaps, or pathfinding iterations, as the algorithm runs.
